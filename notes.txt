2008.07.26 -- saturday night -- Dialogs were getting "stuck behind" again, on latest Mac OS X, Leopard.
By random experiments, I found the fix is to make sure the executable lives inside folders called Contents/MacOS/.
It is crazy but true.

Also, Rez was complaining about my stdin sourcing for carb, so I added carb.r to the build.
